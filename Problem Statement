Problem Statement: Virtual Bot Arena Navigation

Objective:
Design an autonomous bot that navigates a structured arena, traverses all paths, and completes a full round, returning to the home zone while following movement rules.

Arena Description:

The arena consists of two main paths (inner and outer squares) connected by four linking paths of different colors.

The bot can switch between inner and outer paths only via the connecting paths.

Bot movement is restricted to a clockwise direction. Any black-colored areas are restricted and cannot be traversed.

The arena contains three shapes — square, circle, and triangle — each in two distinct colors, creating 6 distinguishable blocks. Shape positions may change but remain distinguishable.

The outermost path contains four arrows indicating the Starting Zone where the bot is initially placed.

The center of the arena is the home zone.

The bot must traverse the arena completely, visiting all paths and finishing at the home zone.

A video feed from an overhead camera is provided; the bot must be autonomously guided using this feed.

Constraints:

Movement is clockwise only.

Restricted areas (black portions) must be avoided.

Shapes may change color but are always distinguishable.

Goal:
Implement an autonomous system that uses the camera feed to control the bot, ensuring it traverses all paths, respects movement constraints, and finishes at the home zone.
